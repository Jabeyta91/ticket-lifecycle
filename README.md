By being an Admin I first created mock tickets to be solved. Agents such as level 1 or level 2 may be restricted access to seeing tickets. Within Admin Panel -> Agents ->Access I can change the department and roles for technicians to have more access to tickets than others.

I had previously set tickets to default notmal so they havent been assigned to anyone. In helpdesk environment management would go through and assign tickets and check SLA's for each ticket. This is just a point of view from a technician role.

As a general inquiry for example I created a mock ticket about something more related to the role. Changing the priority and reworking the ticket, as a agent and coordinating with other technicians may also be an option. The priority may get changed to emergency.
